# Cough-Detection-System-using-Arduino-33-BLE-Sense

COVID19 is really a historic pandemic affecting the whole world very badly and people are building a lot of new devices to fight with it. We have also built an automatic sanitization machine and Thermal Gun for Contactless temperature screening. Today we will build one more device to help fighting with Coronavirus. It is a cough detection system, which can distinguish between noise and cough sound and can help finding Corona suspect. It will use machine learning techniques for that.
